Custom Achievements can be defined by calling `AmazingTrophiesAPI::registerAchievement` during the init phase of your mod or via JSON config files. These config files must be put in `./config/amazingtrophies/`. You can order the files by using as many subdirectories as you wish.

> [!NOTE]
>  The file tree is traversed depth-first and in lexicographical order (ignoring upper/lower cases). Example:
> 1. `./a/a/apple.json`
> 2. `./a/plum.json`
> 3. `./B/fig.json`
> 4. `./c/a/kiwi.json`
> 5. `./BANANA.json`
> 6. `./durian.json`

Amazing Trophies
=================
*Inspired by [FTB Trophies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftbtrophies) - but FOSS and far more capable!*

### Features
- You can add custom Achievements
- You can add custom Trophies
- Both Achievements and Trophies can be defined via code and/or config files
- The config directory also works as a resourcepack for everything under the `amazingtrophies` domain (this is useful for lang files and trophy models/textures)

Look at the [wiki](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Amazing-Trophies/wiki) for details about the configs!
